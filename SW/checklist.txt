TESTS TO DO:
	Send MP3 File
	Retrieve inputs

FILESTOCREATE:
NV3035C DRIVERS

Board Support Package for GameMan board (maps between system_stm32f4xxx.h and my files) with memory copied input definitions of locations
	I2C get touch routines
	get input routines
	memory module definitions
	port and pin definitions
	Nor Flash writing/reading routines (draw inspiration from EVAL board's)

every game has Game header file that includes all gameobjects it needs and defines game flow state machine
	
gameobject/drawable object files contain gameobject struct definition who has update void pointer and function for that defined in this file, on all updates be sure to do input/AI updates before status changes
	gameobject struct contents: ex. moving sprite gameobject which contains mario, or a goomba
		image pointer
		related information needed (location, velocity, sizexy, etc)
		animation frame
		whether or not to draw it
		
			DRAWOBJECT
				void* ObjectDatas;
				void (*Draw)();
				
			RectangleObject (example of ObjectDatas)
				xyposition topleft;
				length l;
				width w;
				image* im;
				
			DrawRectangleObjectCPU(RectangleObject* obj) (example of Draw function for RectangleObject in it's file.h) //may have to do some casting to get this to work
				memcpy(FRAMEBUFFER + getXYOffset(obj->xyposition), obj->im, 			l*w); //obviously this is a test, we'd mostly use DMA2D...

Drawable/GameObjects to create:
	Rectangular_Object
	Text
	solid shape examples

CARTDRIDGE STUFF:
Learn how to use FATfs
create file for unique game ID


MALLOC STUFF:
NOT POSSIBLE--How to place heap in multiple locations (internal first external after)
how to use new/malloc -- TRY init_mempool and just mallocing...? http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/ca/ca_init_mempool.htm


Parts for external stuff:
debug USART
"multiplayer" UART
I2c for touch screen and mp3
FMC
PWM for brightness
PWM for vibration
GPIO latch for inputs
spi for buttons
spi for mp3
2x GPIO for mp3
spi for LCD control
ADC for battery

RTC from LSE can be on from just VBAT, ~1 uA 
	get directly from battery LDO
