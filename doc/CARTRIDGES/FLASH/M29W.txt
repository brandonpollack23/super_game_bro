- Release Version 1.0 (24 February 2014)

  M29W_device_driver.h   v1.0
  M29W_device_driver.c   v1.0
	Initial release of device-specific code.  In reality this device 
	driver is compatible with all other Micron Spansion-style devices 
	and is provided for completeness.  It does have code which will 
	handle multiple-die parts which some of the other drivers do not, 
	and it also has code to read the program buffer size from the CFI, 
	which older versions of this driver do not do.
